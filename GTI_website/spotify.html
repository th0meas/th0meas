                    <h2>An introduction to my music taste</h2>
                    <p>This year's Spotify Wraped was very satisfying for me.
                        My two top artists, Masayoshi Takanaka and Casiopea make
                        music that's in the "Jazz Fusion" genre, something I 
                        discovered at the start of the year. Their music is very
                        pleasing and can be heard at every ocation, making it 
                        one of the best genres of music out there, in my opinion.
                        Following, Linkin Park, is a very famous band. Their 
                        distinctive sound is known all across the world, being
                        one of the bands that pioneered the Nu-Metal sounds, with
                        Mike Shinoda's rap vocals and Chester Bennington's powerfull
                        metal growl and melodic voice, backed up by a very metal
                        sounding band. Their music is filled with emotions, some
                        being relatable in my daily life. Coping with an artist's 
                        music and lyrics is something I appreciate when listening
                        to music. Aespa, totally differenet from my top three, is a
                        K-Pop group. In my opinion, the most creative and best 
                        sounding group in the k-pop music industry at the moment.
                        They have great visuals and sound, making cool performances
                        in every video clip they release. At number five, Lamp, was
                        my companion at chill moments. Wether I was studying, laying 
                        in bed, taking a walk, Lamp is there to chill you out. Their
                        bosa-nova and jazzy sound along with very soft vocals, is 
                        the perfect combination to vibe to something that's gonna
                        relax your brain completely.

                        My music journey started when I was in primary
                        school, using the family laptop to search music 
                        on YouTube. I was mainly listening to classic rock
                        songs, but also some of the mainstream pop tracks
                        of the time. I did not give much attention to music
                        back then, but I was taking drumming lessons. In gymnasium,
                        I discovered metal music. It took over my mind completely.
                        I was pretty stuck with metal for a while, but I did listen 
                        to other stuff meanwhile as well. Since then, I have discovered
                        many other genres of metal, rock and pop music. As well as hip-
                        hop and rap music. Jazz and the Blues. Tons of Japanese musi... the 
                        'City Pop' genre was my no.1 genre in 2023. I can't think of 
                        something else to mention at the moment, but I listen to a lot
                        of music. But, out of them all, I think the band BABYMETAL has
                        won my heart the most. Being in the industry since a young age,
                        the trio basically discovered "cute metal", or "kawaii metal"  in 
                        Japanese. I am super excited because I am going to see them
                        live at Amsterdam in May 2025. Their music is not for everyone, 
                        most of my friends do not understand dhow I can have such a big 
                        obsession with them. But, it's definitely my go-to comfort music.
