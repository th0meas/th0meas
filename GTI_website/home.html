                        My name is Andreas Iordanis Thomaidis. I am 19 years old and I live in Thessaloniki, Greece. I am an undergraduate student in the International Hellenic University at Thessaloniki. I study in the Department of Information and Electronic Engineering, and I am currently in the second year of my studies.
    My hobbies consist of music and video games. I have been playing the drums and the bass guitar since I was very little. Video games comfort me whenever I feel bored and have nothing else to do, and are very fun to play with friends. Lastly, reading manga
    or watching anime is also one of my favorite hobbies / activities.
