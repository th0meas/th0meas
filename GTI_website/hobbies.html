                <h2>Kick Boxing</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I started kick boxing in January of 2024, after a friend from
                    work talked about the type of training the do at the gym. I 
                    was very interested in starting right away. At first, I rarely 
                    visited the gym, mostly due to the exam period at the time,
                    but after March I was really into the sport. That was the period 
                    when I started seeing that I was improving, and the training
                    was going by easier for me. Practice there is very demanding, 
                    we do lots and different kinds of workouts, including mostly 
                    cardio. The sport itself is very interesting. There are many 
                    techniques to learn and always improve. The skill ceiling is 
                    infinite in kick boxing, and that's what I like most.

                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Video Games have been a part of my life for many years.
                    We had a Wii at our house and I would play with my sisters
                    or friends whenever they came over. I also had a PSP that 
                    I would carry around with me in trips and vacations. At 7th 
                    grade I got gifted a PS4 and a couple years later I got
                    my first computer, on which I played a lot of games too.
                    Even today, I still game sometimes, trying out new games
                    or revisiting old ones for nostalgic reasons. Also playing
                    with friends is very fun and a nice way to get back with 
                    people you havne't talked in a while.

                <h2>Drums</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    I started playing the drums when I was 7 years old, and have
                    been playing since. It is a hobby I really love and give a lot 
                    of attention to, because I am also a big fan of music in general.
                    My drumming journey started when I wore a t-shirt with a print of Elmo,
                    (a muppet character), playing the drums. I went to my local music school
                    and started lessons with my teacher, who I am friends with, even though
                    I stopped having lessons at 17, two years ago. However, I still play the
                    drums from time to time. It is hard for me to play because I have an 
                    acoustic kit and I have placed it in a warehouse at Sindos, close to 
                    university.

                <h2>Bass Guitar</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    After many years of playing the drums, at 15, I decided
                    to start learning another instrument. It is common for 
                    drummers to also play bass, and vise-versa. So, I picked
                    up the bass guitar! I really liked the low frequences
                    that came out of my amplifier - which I had made with 
                    my dad in fifth grade, as a fun electronics project!
                    Nowadays, I play the bass more than I do the drums. 
                    That's because I have my bass guitar right next to me 
                    at home. I started learning the "slap" technique, which
                    is a fun and very funky way to play the bass.
